## Dependency Notes

This project requires pydantic>=1.5.0 to ensure compatibility with various environments. 
The direct dependency on pydantic has been relaxed from >=2.0.0 to >=1.5.0 to address 
compatibility issues in some environments where only older versions of pydantic are available.

The fastmcp library, which this project depends on, is compatible with both pydantic 1.x and 2.x,
so this change should not affect functionality.
